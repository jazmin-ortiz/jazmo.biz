  <h1>Jazmin's Bootstrap Website</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Jazmin. I'm a software engineer and this is my dumb little scrolly website.</p>
  <p>If you want to look at a *slightly* more polished thing I made and look and learn more about me go to <a href="https://www.jazminortiz.com">jazminortiz.com</a></p>

    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
      <p>Bootstrap websites are everywhere and they all have this same look.</p>
      <p>The content may be different but the user experience gives it away..</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
      <p>It feels like the elements that boostrap provides sort of pushes you to put all of the information into a single page.</p>
      <p>I feel like every bootstrap website you end up swiping all around on a single page. So Scrolly!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>        
      <p>It seems like the general consensus is that bootstrap makes it very easy to make a fairly polished website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>        
        <p>I want to see how easy boostrap is and make a dumb little scrolly website like all the ones I see online.</p>
